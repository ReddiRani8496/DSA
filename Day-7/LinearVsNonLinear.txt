                Linear Data Structure                           Non-Linear Data Structure
                ---------------------                           -------------------------

-> In a linear data structure, data elements                -> In a non-linear data structure, data
        are arranged in a linear order                           elements are attached in hierarchically manner.

->  single level is involved.                               -> multiple levels are involved.

-> implementation is easy                                   -> implementation is complex

-> data elements can be traversed in a single run only.     -> data elements canâ€™t be traversed in a single run only

-> memory is not utilized in an efficient way.              -> memory is utilized in an efficient way. 

-> examples are: array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.     -> examples are: trees, graphs etc.

-> useful for simple data storage and manipulation.         ->  useful for representing complex relationships and data hierarchies.

-> Performance is good for adding and removing at ends.     -> Performance can vary depending on the structure and the operation.
    But slow at searching or removing middle elements.
