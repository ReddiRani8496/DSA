What is programming?
--------------------

Set of instructions given to the computer to perform specific task.

programming is not about typing, it is about thinking.

Why we need to master in data structures?
-----------------------------------------

Build fast and scalable algorithms.

Cost saving and effecient.

The art of problem solving.

Data strucure types:
--------------------

There are two types of data structures:

            Linear Data Structure:                                              Non-Linear Data Structure
            ----------------------                                              -------------------------

            -> Arrays                                                           -> Trees 
            -> Stack                                                            -> Graphs
            -> Queue   
            -> Linkedlist                                                          
            -> Hash Map(HashTables)


Clean code:
---------

Clean code contains:

Clear and Descriptive names 
Make code easier to understand.
variables and methods names follow camel case.
Class names follow Pascal case.

DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself):
--------------------------

If you write the same code in multiple places extract that into a function(reuse).

Keep Functions small:[KISS principle Keep It Simple and Stupid]
---------------------------------------------------------------

Every function should do one thing only and do it well.
Function is crossing more than 10lines that means it is doing many things, 
    that indicates the time to break it down.

-> Writing comments is not alternative for clean code.

-> Better ways of doing a thing, refactoring is part of the coding process.
