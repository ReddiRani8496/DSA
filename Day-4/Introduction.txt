Why algorithms are needed?

For non-technical persons it is difficult to understand the code, but they can easily understand the algorithms.



Why computers need algorithms over humans?

Because computers are accurate and speed.



Why flow charts are required?

It is easy to understand the picture in less time than theory. So flow charts are used.



Why pseudo code required?

Different people use different programming languages, and that often becomes a problem.
If you implement an algorithm you've written in one particular language, developers who don't know that language would hardly be able to understand it. 
To solve this problem, you can use pseudocode.
