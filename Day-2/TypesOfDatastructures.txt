Data structures:
----------------

1. Linear Data structures
2. Non-linear Data structures

Linear Data structures:
----------------------
Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 

Non-linear data structure: 
--------------------------
Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 



Linear Data Structure Examples:
-------------------------------
i. Arrays - An array is a linear data structure and it is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. 
ii. Linked Lists - A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
iii. Stack - Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. (LIFO)
iv. Queue - Queue is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.(FIFO)
v. Hashtable - Stores elements in key-value pairs (Non-Synchronized)
vi. HashMap - Stores elements in key-value pairs (Synchronized)

Non-linear Data Structure Examples:
----------------------------------
i. Trees 
ii. Graphs
