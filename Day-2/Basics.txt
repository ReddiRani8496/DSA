How to approach a problem?

Read the problem --> Analyze the problem --> Think of a solution --> Pen down the solution --> Code the solution
                                                                      * Flow chart
                                                                      * Algorithm
                                                                      * Pseudo code

If we have multiple solutions for a problem, we select the solution based on Time complexity and Space complexity.

Trade-off:
---------

A tradeoff is a situation where one thing increases and another thing decreases. It is a way to solve a problem in:

Either in less time and by using more space, or

In very little space by spending a long amount of time.

What is procedural language?

A procedural language is a type of computer programming language that specifies a series of well-structured steps and 
    procedures within its programming context to compose a program. 

It contains a systematic order of statements, functions and commands to complete a computational task or program.
