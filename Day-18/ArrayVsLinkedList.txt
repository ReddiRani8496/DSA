            Array                                                        Linked List

-> Arrays are stored in contiguos location.                         -> Linked Lists are not stored in contiguos location.

-> Fixed in size.                                                   -> Dynamic in size

-> Memory allocated at compile time.                                -> Memory allocated at runtime.

-> Uses less Memory than Linked list.                               -> Uses more memory because it stores data and node.

-> Elements can be accessed easily.                                 -> Elements accessing requires the traversal of whole linked list.

-> Insertion and deletion operations takes time.                    -> Insertion and deletion operation is faster.
