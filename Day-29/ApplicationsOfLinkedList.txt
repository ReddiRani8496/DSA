Applications of linked list in computer science:
------------------------------------------------

->  Implementation of stacks and queues
->  Implementation of graphs: Adjacency list representation of graphs is the most popular which uses a linked list to store adjacent vertices.
->  Dynamic memory allocation: We use a linked list of free blocks.
->  Maintaining a directory of names
->  Performing arithmetic operations on long integers
->  Manipulation of polynomials by storing constants in the node of the linked list
->  Representing sparse matrices

Applications of linked list in the real world:
-----------------------------------------------

Image viewer – 
                Previous and next images are linked and can be accessed by the next and previous buttons.

Previous and next page in a web browser – 
---------------------------------------
                            We can access the previous and next URL searched in a web browser by pressing the back and next buttons since they are linked as a linked list.
Music Player – 
------------   
                Songs in the music player are linked to the previous and next songs. So you can play songs either from starting or ending of the list.

GPS navigation systems-
----------------------
         Linked lists can be used to store and manage a list of locations and routes, allowing users to easily navigate to their desired destination.
Robotics- 
--------        
        Linked lists can be used to implement control systems for robots, allowing them to navigate and interact with their environment.

Task Scheduling- 
---------------                
                Operating systems use linked lists to manage task scheduling, where each process waiting to be executed is represented as a node in the list.

Image Processing- 
----------------    
            Linked lists can be used to represent images, where each pixel is represented as a node in the list.

File Systems- 
-----------
        File systems use linked lists to represent the hierarchical structure of directories, where each directory or file is represented as a node in the list.

Symbol Table- 
------------    
        Compilers use linked lists to build a symbol table, which is a data structure that stores information about identifiers used in a program.

Undo/Redo Functionality- 
----------------------
        Many software applications implement undo/redo functionality using linked lists, where each action that can be undone is represented as a node in a doubly linked list.
