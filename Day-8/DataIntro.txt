Why can we need to store data in hard disk?
-------------------------------------------

We can give instructions to the computer using keyboard, for simple code it will be easy, but in companies we deal 

with large amount of code, for ex, millions of lines. Then it will be hard to type the entire code.

To make the work easy, the data will be stored in hard disk.

Why RAM is needed?
------------------

If we send data from hard disk to CPU, it takes large amount of time, to reduce transfer time and increase speed,

the necessary data will be transfered to RAM from hard disk, then from RAM data will be transfered to CPU.

The data in RAM is temporary.

RAM and CPU is made up of semi conductor technology.

Where as HDD is made up of magnetic technology.

Why can't we store the entire hard disk data to RAM?
----------------------------------------------------

Because RAM doesn't have enough space and RAM is costly.

Why CPU understand only binary language?
----------------------------------------

Because CPU is made up of transistors, transistors supports only 0's and 1's.

Why Data Structure needed?
--------------------------

Arrangement of collection of data times, in a well organized manner.

Difference between data structures and data base?
------------------------------------------------

-> Data structure is a way of storing and arranging data efficiently in temporary memory.

-> Data base is a collection of data that is stored and managed in permanent memory.

Difference between files and data base?
--------------------------------------

                Files                                                Data base

-> The file system is a way of arranging the files              -> DBMS is software for managing the database.
    in a storage medium within a computer.

-> Redundant data can be present.                               -> there is no redundant data.

-> It doesnâ€™t provide backup and recovery                       -> It provides backup and recovery of data even if it is lost
    of data if it is lost.
