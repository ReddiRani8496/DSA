A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree in which 
    the left child of a node has a value less than the node’s value 
    and the right child has a value greater than the node’s value.

Applications:
------------
-> BSTs are used for indexing in databases.
-> It is used to implement searching algorithms.
-> BSTs are used to implement Huffman coding algorithm.
-> It is also used to implement dictionaries.
-> Used for data caching.
-> Used in Priority queues.
-> Used in spell checkers.
-> Auto completion
-> Compression
-> DNS
-> TLD

Advantages
----------

-> Efficient Searching
-> Memory Efficient
-> Fast insertion and deletion
-> Easy to implement
-> Useful for sorting

Disadvantages:
-------------

-> Limited structure
-> Unbalanced trees
-> Space inefficiency
-> slow performance in worst sece
