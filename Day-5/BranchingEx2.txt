What will the program output be when executed?

a = 2
b = 3
c = 4
b = b - 1
a = a + b
// c = c / 2
rezt = (a + b + c) / 2 
c = 0
if rezt < 5 then:
   print(a)
elif rezt > 5 then:
   print(b)
else:
   print(c)

Output:
-----

b =3-1 = 2
a = 2+2 =4
rezt = (4+2+4)/2 = 5
c = 0 // c is assigned to 0
5<5 condition fails
5 > 5 condition fails
else part prints c value i.e., 0. // in line number 10 c value is updated to 0
