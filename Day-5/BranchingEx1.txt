What will the following program output when executed?

count = 5
let_us = 2.63
if ((count * 3) / 7) >= let_us then:
   print("Let's count", let_us + count)
else:
   print("Let's count", let_us * count)


Output:
------

count*3/7 => (5*3)/7=>2.14
2.14>=2.63 condition fails

else part will be executed
prints 2.63 * 5 = 13.15
