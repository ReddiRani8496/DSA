//You have been given a random array of integers and the following piece of pseudocode. Choose what the program below does, given the array a:

for j in (2, len(a)):
    t = a[j]
    i = j − 1

    while (i >= 1) and a[i] > t:
        a[i + 1] = a[i]
        i = i − 1

    a[i + 1] = t

print(a)

// Answer: Sort the array
