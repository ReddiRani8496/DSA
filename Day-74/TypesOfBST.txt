Full Binary Tree
----------------

A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.

Perfect Binary Tree
-------------------

A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and 
all the leaf nodes are at the same level

Complete Binary Tree
--------------------

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled from the left.

A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences

All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a full binary tree.
