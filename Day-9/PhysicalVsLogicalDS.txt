Physical Data Structure:
-----------------------

The Array and LinkedList are the two physical data structures.

Why we are calling array and linked list as physical data structures?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Because these two data structures decide or define how the memory is organized or how the memory is allocated.

Array:
-----

The Array is a collection of contiguous memory locations.
The array will have a fixed size. Once it is created with some size, then that size cannot be increased or decreased.

Where the array can be created?
------------------------------

It can be created inside the heap.

When to use the array data structure?
-------------------------------------

 when we are sure what is the maximum number of elements that we are going to store. 

 That means if we know the length of the list then we need to go for the array data structure.

Linked list:
-----------
The Linked List data structure is a completely dynamic data structure.
It is a collection of nodes where each node contains data and a link to the next node. 
The length of the linked list can grow and reduce dynamically.

Where the linked list can be created?
-------------------------------------

The linked list is always created in the heap.

When to use the Linked List data structure?
-------------------------------------------

We need to go with the linked list data structure when we are not sure what is the maximum number of elements that we are going to store. 

 

-> These two data structures are physical data structures because they define how the memory should be organized for storing the elements or data.
-> These are more related to memory.


Difference between the logical data structure and the physical data structure:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Physical data structures are actually meant for storing the data in the memory. 

Then on the stored data or values, we may be performing some operations like inserting more values or 
deleting existing values or searching for the values, and many more operations. 

Now, the question is, how you want to utilize those values? 
How you will be performing insertion and deletion? 
What is the discipline that you are going to follow?

-> That discipline is defined by logical data structures i.e. stack, queues, trees, graphs, and hash table.
