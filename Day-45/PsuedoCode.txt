1. Create a Stack

2. Iterate the expression

3. If c is operand add it to the result
        ( : push to the Stack
        ) : Pop from stack and add to result until opening bracket
        
    else
        if stack is empty
            push it to stack
        else
            compare with peek
                if higher precedence push to stack
                else pop and add to result until lower precedence found
