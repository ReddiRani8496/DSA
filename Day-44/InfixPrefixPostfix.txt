Infix Expressions
----------------

Infix expressions are the most usual type of expression. 
This notation is typically employed when writing arithmetic expressions by hand.
 Moreover, in the infix expression, we place the operator between the two operands it operates on.

For example, the operator “+” appears between the operands A and B in the expression “A + B”. 

Prefix Expressions
-----------------

Prefix expressions, also known as Polish notation, place the operator before the operands.

For example, in the expression “+ A B”,  we place the “+” operator before the operands A and B.

Postfix Expressions
-------------------

Postfix expressions, also known as reverse Polish notation, where we place the operator after the operands.

For instance, in the expression “A B +”, the “+” we place the operator after the operands A and B.
