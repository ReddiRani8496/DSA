What is algorithm?

 A set of finite rules or instructions to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations.

 Use of the Algorithms:
 --------------------

Algorithms play a crucial role in various fields and have many applications. 

For example:

1. Computer science
2. Mathematics
3. Operations Research
4. Artificial Intelligence
5. Data science.

What is the need for algorithms?

-> Algorithms are necessary for solving complex problems efficiently and effectively. 
-> They help to automate processes and make them more reliable, faster, and easier to perform.
-> Algorithms also enable computers to perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible for humans to do manually.

Characteristics of an Algorithm?

1. Well defined inputs
2. Clear and unambiguous
3. Language independent
4. Feasible
5. Finite-ness 
6. Well defined outputs

Properties of Algorithm:
-----------------------

-> It should terminate after a finite time.
-> It should produce at least one output.
-> It should take zero or more input.
-> It should be deterministic means giving the same output for the same input case.
-> Every step in the algorithm must be effective i.e. every step should do some work.

Types of Algorithm:
------------------

1. Brute force algorithm
2. Recursive algorithm
3. Backtracking algorithm
4. Searching algorithm
5. Sorting algorithm
6. Hashing algorithm
7. Divide and conquer Algorithm
8. Greedy algorithm
9. Dynamic programming algorithm
10. Randomized algorithm

Advantages of Algorithms:
------------------------

-> It is easy to understand.
-> An algorithm is a step-wise representation of a solution to a given problem.
-> In an Algorithm the problem is broken down into smaller pieces or steps hence, it is easier for the programmer to convert it into an actual program.

Disadvantages of Algorithms:
---------------------------

-> Writing an algorithm takes a long time so it is time-consuming.
-> Understanding complex logic through algorithms can be very difficult.
-> Branching and Looping statements are difficult to show in Algorithms(imp).

How to Design an Algorithm?
---------------------------

-> The problem that is to be solved by this algorithm i.e. clear problem definition.
-> The constraints of the problem must be considered while solving the problem.
-> The input to be taken to solve the problem.
-> The output is to be expected when the problem is solved.
-> The solution to this problem is within the given constraints.
