How Time complexity is described?

Best case
Average case
Worst case 

Big O: Describes the performance of an algorithm.

To check whether the application is scalable or not.

Time and Efficiency are inversly proportional:
---------------------------------------------

Less Time  - More Efficiency

More Time  - Less Efficiency
